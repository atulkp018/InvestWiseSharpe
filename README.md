# Stock Performance Analysis with Sharpe Ratios

## Overview

This project evaluates the performance of stocks using the **Sharpe Ratio**, a key metric for assessing risk-adjusted returns. By analyzing the stocks of **Facebook** and **Amazon**, and comparing them against the **S&P 500** benchmark, this project demonstrates how to make informed investment decisions based on historical data.

The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of stock prices and benchmark trends
- Computation of Sharpe Ratios to assess risk-adjusted returns

## About the Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio, introduced by Nobel laureate **William Sharpe**, measures the additional return per unit of risk for an investment compared to a benchmark. It is calculated as:

$$S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma}$$

Where:
- $R_p$: Return of the portfolio or investment
- $R_f$: Risk-free rate of return
- $\sigma$: Standard deviation of excess returns (a measure of risk)

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.
## Data

The dataset includes:
- Daily stock prices for **Amazon** and **Facebook**
- Daily prices for the **S&P 500** index as the benchmark

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis uses the following Python libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: For numerical computations
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization

## Key Insights

1. Visualization of historical stock prices reveals trends and volatility patterns for Amazon, Facebook, and the S&P 500.
2. Sharpe Ratios provide a quantitative comparison of risk-adjusted returns for the stocks relative to the benchmark.

## Usage

To explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the results step-by-step.
